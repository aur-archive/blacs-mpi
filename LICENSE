 1.5) Are there legal restrictions on the use of ScaLAPACK software?

 ScaLAPACK (like LINPACK, EISPACK, LAPACK, etc) is a freely-available software 
 package. It is available from netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web.
 It can, and is, being included in commercial packages (e.g., Sun's S3L, IBM's 
 Parallel ESSL, NAG Numerical PVM and Interactive Supercomputing's Star-P for 
 MATLAB). We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors.

 Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do ask the 
 following:

 If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change the name of 
 the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

 We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a modification 
 is done, however, it is the responsibility of the person who modified the 
 routine to provide support.
